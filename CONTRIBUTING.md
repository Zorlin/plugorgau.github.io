## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/plugorgau/website/search?type=Issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). When you create an issue try and provide the following information where appropriate:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most plugorgau members.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to plugorgau/website? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests should come from topic branches on forks of the plugorgau repo and target the master branch.

Preferably the branch would be named gh-pages and hosted on github so that the changes could be viewed via github pages.

Once the pull request receives a +1 from a core contributor it is ready to be merged to master.

If the pull request has come from a core contributor it is their responsibility to merge.

Try and use the following guidelines when creating pull requests.
