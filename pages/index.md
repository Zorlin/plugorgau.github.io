The Perth Linux Users' Group (PLUG) is Perth's only Linux users group.

We are a not-for-profit incorporated association for professionals, students or hobbyists interested in Linux and Open Source software. Whilst we have many members in Perth, we welcome members from all over Western Australia.

We meet each month in Perth and also organise a number of social events throughout the year. PLUG streams its talks live online, and encourages all members to watch or chat on irc.

PLUG aims to promote Linux and support the users of Linux in Western Australia. Read our about page for more info http://plug.org.au/about

We also provide a number of resources for members, so check our website links above.
