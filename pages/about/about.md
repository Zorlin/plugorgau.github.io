The _Perth Linux Users' Group_ (PLUG) is one of the largest Linux groups in Australia!

We are a not-for-profit [incorporated association](http://www.search.asic.gov.au/cgi-bin/gns030c?state_number=A1007186U&juris=6&hdtext=WA&srchsrc=1) for professionals, students or hobbyists interested in Linux and Open Source software. Whilst most of our membership is from Perth, we welcome members from all over Western Australia and currently have members from Broome, Collie, Katanning and Kalgoorlie.

We meet each month in Perth and also organise a number of social events throughout the year (see our [events page]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/) for more information). PLUG streams its monthly meetings live online, and encourages regional members to get together to watch the stream and participate online via _IRC_ in real time.

PLUG aims to promote Linux and support the users of Linux in Western Australia. We also aim to:

*   Advocate the use of Linux and Open Source software (where appropriate)
*   Learn new skills from knowledgeable industry experts
*   Make it easier for local users to get assistance
*   Encourage our members to share their experiences and expert knowledge
*   Make contacts within the industry
*   Make new friends

We also provide a number of [resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) for members and others interested in Linux and Open Source software.
