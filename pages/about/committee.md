The PLUG committee consists of seven members who are elected annually during the Annual General Meeting held at the beginning of each calendar year.

{% comment %}
I think that the current committee should be expanded (i.e. have heading for each member) while previous committees should be compact (i.e. just make their title in bold).

Also to make a line break after each entry make sure there are two spaces at the end of the line.
