# PLUG Events
PLUG holds a monthly presentation and discussion meeting on the second Tuesday every month. Some of the meetings are given by local experts and where possible we have had interstate speakers present too. We also host an annual quiz night, summer barbecue/Christmas party and workshops. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to meet other fellow minded people. There are no presentations, just come and share a drink.
