# PLUG Events
PLUG holds a monthly presentation and discussion meeting on the second Tuesday every month. Some of the meetings are given by local experts and where possible we have had interstate speakers present too. We also host an annual quiz night, summer barbecue/Christmas party and workshops. Most of our meetings are held at SpaceCubed.com - 45 St Georges Terrace in the Perth CBD and talks begin at 7:00pm. (Check out the live streaming of the meeting).

# PLUG in the Pub
PLUG in the Pub is a social gathering of the Linux and Open Source community in Perth held usually on the last Monday of every other month.  Since the Moon and Sixpence closed, we are trying a range of different pubs! Check our Meetup site for the next Plug in the Pub.

Itâ€™s a great opportunity to meet other fellow minded people. There are no presentations, just come and share a drink.
