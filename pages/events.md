# PLUG Events
PLUG holds a monthly presentation and discussion meeting on the second Tuesday every month. Some of the meetings are given by local experts and where possible we have had interstate speakers present too. We also host an annual quiz night, summer barbecue and workshops. Most of the meetings are held at SpaceCubed.com 45 St Georges Terrace Perth CBD and begin at 7pm. (Check out the live streaming of the meeting).

# PLUG in the Pub
PLUG in the Pub is a social gathering of the Linux and Open Source community in Perth held on the last Monday of every other month. It is usually held at the Moon and Sixpence in Murray St from whatever time you finish work!

Itâ€™s a great opportunity to meet other fellow minded people. There are no presentations, just come and share a drink.
